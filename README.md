### Hello!
My name is Andrew Xanthos. I'm a senior IT student at Pace University.

I mostly work with JavaScript (primarily Node and React).

I'm currently working on...
  1. A word game (Electron)
  2. A Warcraft-themed news site (React, Gatsby)
  3. A language leaning platform (Express, Vanilla JS)

To see some projects I've worked on, take a look at [my site](https://www.andrewxanthos.com/)!
